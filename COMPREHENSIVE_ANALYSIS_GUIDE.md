## Analysis Components

### 1. Sentiment Label Comparison Analysis

**Purpose**: Compare the four sentiment labeling methods to understand their characteristics and agreement levels.

**Methods Analyzed**:
- **Score-based**: Based on user ratings (1-2=negative, 3=neutral, 4-5=positive)
- **TextBlob**: Rule-based sentiment analysis
- **VADER**: Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner
- **Ensemble**: Weighted voting of all three methods

**Statistics Generated**:
- Distribution counts and percentages for each method
- Chi-square tests for independence between methods
- Agreement matrix showing proportion of matching labels
- Statistical significance tests

**Key Findings from Demo**:
- Score-based: 55.8% positive, 39.1% negative, 5.1% neutral
- TextBlob: 90.5% neutral, 7.9% positive, 1.6% negative
- VADER: 93.7% positive, 6.3% neutral
- Ensemble: 53.2% positive, 36.4% negative, 10.4% neutral
- Highest agreement: Score-based vs Ensemble (92.2%)
- Lowest agreement: Score-based vs TextBlob (11.6%)

### 2. Feature Extraction Comparison

**Purpose**: Compare TF-IDF and Word2Vec feature extraction methods across different algorithms.

**Feature Types**:
