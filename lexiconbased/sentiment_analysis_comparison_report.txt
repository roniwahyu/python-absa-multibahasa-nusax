RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------
• Use Naive Bayes for higher accuracy requirements
• Naive Bayes shows better performance on complex cases
• Consider training time if real-time deployment is needed
• VADER is significantly faster for predictions
• Consider ensemble approach combining both methods
• Evaluate on your specific domain data before final decision
