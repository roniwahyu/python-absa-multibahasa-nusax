markdown_report = comparison.generate_detailed_report(format='markdown')
```

### Custom Analysis

```python
# Custom dataset analysis
comparison = SentimentAnalyzerComparison()
comparison.initialize_analyzers()

# Use your own data
custom_texts = ["Your Indonesian texts here..."]
custom_labels = ["positive", "negative", "neutral"]

# Train and evaluate
comparison.nb_analyzer.train(custom_texts, custom_labels)
# ... run comparison with custom data
```

### Preview Generation

```python
# Generate quick preview
python generate_markdown_report.py
# Choose option 2 for preview
```
